  <p>Let's say there's a program <code class="java">process_four_numbers.py</code>. It takes exactly four arguments, all of which are numerical.</p> 
  <p>Inside this script, the first thing to do it is to get the arguments from the command line. This is already done in the code. Your task is to access <strong>the arguments</strong> and print them as a list. Note that all arguments must be <strong>integers</strong>!</p>
